# DQM Playground - Data Science Framework

The goal of this repository is to provide a data science framework to explore various anomaly detection strategies in the context of the CMS Tracker DQM Playground effort. The code for the website hosting the data and allowing to inspect them can be found [here](https://github.com/CMSTrackerDPG/MLplayground). An optional Command Line Interface to get the data can be found [here](https://github.com/XavierAtCERN/dqm-playground-cli).
